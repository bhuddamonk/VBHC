# VBHC
A quick front end mock up of a Value Based Health Care application for a project I was working on. 
Its standard HTML/CSS using a bootstrap template for a potenbtial start up project idea. 

If you want to view the mockup, just clone the repo and open up the index.html locally in your broswer. 
Obviously, this is just a mock up so there is no authentication in the application, just Submit and it will
take you to the dashboard/landing page.
